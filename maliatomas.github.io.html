        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>
            In this lesson was an introduction to the teaching team and a breakdown of the course assignments. We discussed the pre-recorded lectures and weekly quizzes that would go towards our grades. We started off the lesson with an icebreaker which allowed us to get to know our classmates. We then moved on to discussing the assignment exemplars which I thought were helpful in terms of getting an understanding of what was expected and what previous student's ideas were. I am looking forward to assignment one because I love making up user personas and creating a solution to the problems they have. This is a very satisfying task and I like the idea that we are carrying on with the same idea the whole course. When you carry through the concept the whole time I find that you can improve and refine the idea to compile a refined and iterated idea.

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>
            In this lesson, we started to create the user personas and gain an understanding of the elements that should be included in the assignment. I found this interesting because I love making up fictional characters. My mind started to flow with ideas of character traits and a problem this character faces daily. I wanted to do something that related to me as a uni student and some of the feelings I felt. I started to brainstorm a mental health website that allows the user to browse through multiple sources to help them deal with the burnout of work/university. I also found the early sites interesting because we forget about what these sites look like and focus on the websites that are present. I thought it was funny how Google originally started as a research project and that the name is a misspelling of the word googol.

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>
            In this lesson, we learned about SVG how it was developed, and how it is used. This was new to my knowledge so I found it cool to learn something that can be used in some more of my assignments. I don’t have much understanding about coding but have always been interested in learning the basics of it. I thought that the information supplied in the lectures was really important information that could be applied in multiple different courses and assignments. The Venn diagram is a really good way to visually show the design and user goals plus the goals that they both share. This makes it nice and clear what they are trying to express. At first, I didn’t understand how SVG and CMS worked but the examples and photos made it much clearer to understand and I was able to start on the coding lectures and start to practice how to start a website.

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>
            I was excited when I saw that we were using Figma in the assignment because I am quite familiar with how Figma works it was like a safe place because I was feeling a little bit overwhelmed with the coding lectures and information that was on the lecture slides. I felt that we moved quite through the coding subjects which was hard to understand from the get-go. I liked the look of the customer journey map and thought it was a really good way to visually show stages of emotion, experiences, and expectations. When I started to do my user flow I became quite confused because I felt that the user decisions and actions were based on emotions which then made me confused as to where the outcome should have been. I also found it hard to create the user flow because my concept had heaps of outcomes which made me confused. After all, it would have been huge.

        <h2>Week Five</h2>
        <p>
            I started to refine and look over my assignment one progress. Once I had my user persona down I found it easy to write about it. I chose a wide demographic that could use the website but also linked to my user's specific needs such as overworking and burnout. I wanted to work on writing detailed information about the user's needs and wants which was to help her maintain a social and work-life balance with the help of the website called Balance. I felt like I had completed this assignment at a good timeline but I forgot to get feedback. I feel like the layout and overall design of the PDF could have been more balanced with fewer words on the page. It just looked like a lot of information slapped onto one page. I think that I could have changed the colors of the flow diagram as well just to make each section stand out more.

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>
            I found it helpful learning about the basics of color because I feel like a lot of design lectures already expect you to know the fundamentals of this. I didn’t know what hexadecimal was which was a really good thing to know because I can apply this to all my assignments that require a color palette. I also didn’t know that there was a tool called Adobe Color which is a really good tool to find color harmony easily whether it be a monochromatic color palette or a complementary color palette. It was also a really helpful tip to change the page to black and white to see if the color harmony makes sense on the page. This was an incredibly easy way to double-check check it looks balanced. This lecture was really helpful because it showed me the importance of a visually striking page and that many layers go into it to make it look complete.

        <h2>Week Seven</h2>
        <p>
            Composition is something I have struggled with when it comes to designing my page. I think that the material supplied on the lecture slides was extremely easy to understand and helped me get an understanding of what and where everything needs to go on the page such as grids, margins, and columns. One of the examples however was slightly hard to read and understand which kind of threw me off but Haowei then explained it again and I was able to understand it. I have been completing my assignment 2 but I found it quite hard to find some photos that linked with the aesthetic of it. I also found it quite hard to make the websites low fid concepts because my idea was to have multiple interactive pages but I could only complete a few which made it feel incomplete.

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>
            We looked at assignment 2.2 and I decided to do CMS for the next assignment. This option was more fitting for my coding ability. I was very unfamiliar with editor x and was hesitant when I first entered the site but after playing around with the site I found it quite easy to find my way around the site. At first, I didn’t realize there was a button option so I made them all from scratch but it was pleasing to say I found that option in the end. After creating my home page it started to flow more and I was able to create more pages with buttons that lead to more pages. I wish I could have finished the rest of the pages but in the timeframe, I was on I wouldn’t have been able to get that done. I liked the overall aesthetic that the website gave it was very calming and minimalistic.

        <h2>Week Nine</h2>
        <p>
            I found it hard to change the size from the website to the phone and tablet. The functions of Editor X were really hard and didn’t let me size them all down at once so it was very time-consuming for me and did not look the best in my opinion. I also had trouble with my aesthetic and went through a period where I thought it was too feminine and so I changed the whole thing with minimalistic shapes as the photo but then I thought that if someone was to enter the site the first thing they would think is what is this website about?. So I then changed the whole thing again and stuck to the original idea which I think is better in terms of feeling free and stress-free. </p>

        <h2>Week Ten</h2>
        <p>
            This week's lesson was to improve on the assignment and keep working on the project. When I went to go and test the website by publishing it it went a really weird size and all the photos and text were in different places. I thought that this was because my screen was zoomed out more and hoped that this wouldn’t have been a problem when it came to marking it. It was very confusing and frustrating because I only tested it at the end so next time I would probably keep testing it throughout every stage that I reach to make sure the final product is correct. Next time I would also allow more time for feedback just to make sure that everything is running smoothly and I have time to make improvements.

        <h2>Week Eleven</h2>
        <p>
            The next stage of the assignment was to code the blog. I had been writing down my blog content every week so I was prepared to start coding the blog. I first brainstormed some ideas on what I wanted the blog to look like. I was leaning towards creating more of a simple and minimalistic blog using a 3x4 box down the page and inserting the text in. I also wanted to incorporate a header with a title to make it easy to understand when you enter the website. I need to continue iterating and working on the coding so that I can send in my concept to get some feedback just in case something isn’t right. I felt that the coding lectures provided were really easy to understand and I was able to apply those skills and instructions into my work.

        <h2>Week Twelve</h2>
        <p>
            I thought this course was really interesting. I liked learning how to code because I felt that it was out of my comfort level and I like to learn new things. Coding is a skill that can be used in different areas of design and I can then use this to my ability. The teaching in this course was very good and well organized. The lectures and slides were presented in an organized manner making it easy to understand even if you were to look back and listen without the recording. The teaching team was great and replied to emails for feedback efficiently. I have taken a lot of good information from this course such as composition, fonts, color, coding, hierarchy, and understanding users. I would definitely recommend this to someone because there is so much information and knowledge you can gain.
